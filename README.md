# Topological Data Analysis: Applications
This repository aims to demonstrate use cases for topological data analysis (TDA). In TDA one attempts to find and exploit topological structures of high dimensional data leading to better understanding of such data and, e.g. new visualization methods. 

## Employing TDA to Text Data
We employ the Mapper Algorithm to sentence embeddings of web search queries in order to reveal semantic structures of such collections of queries.
